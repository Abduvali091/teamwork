    The Wikimedians of the Uzbek language User Group (Uzbek: Oʻzbek tilida soʻzlashuvchi vikimediachilar foydalanuvchi guruhi / Ўзбек тилида сўзлашувчи викимедиачилар фойдаланувчи гуруҳи) is a regional user group representing all Wikimedians who speak the Uzbek language, a Turkic language spoken in Uzbekistan and elsewhere in Central Asia. The group aims to enrich Wikimedia projects in the Uzbek language, particularly the Uzbek Wikipedia and Uzbek Wiktionary. As a regional user group, it serves to encourage Wikimedians in Central Asia and elsewhere to get to know each other, as well as foster support for events in the region.

      <p class="constitution__text">
        The Constitution of Uzbekistan nominally creates a separation of powers among a strong presidency, the legislature (the Supreme Assembly of Uzbekistan or Oliy Majlis), and a judiciary.
        
        The President of Uzbekistan, who is directly elected to a five-year term that can be renewed once, is the head of state and is granted supreme executive power by the constitution. As commander in chief of the armed forces, the President may declare a state of emergency or of war. The President is empowered to nominate a candidate of the prime minister for consideration of chambers of the Oliy Majlis and appoint full cabinet of ministers and the judges of the three national courts, subject to the approval of the Oliy Majlis, and to appoint all members of lower courts. The President also has the power to dissolve the parliament, in effect negating the Oliy Majlis's veto power over presidential nominations in a power struggle situation.[1]
